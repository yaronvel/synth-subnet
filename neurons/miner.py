        Determines whether an incoming request should be blacklisted and thus ignored. Your implementation should
        define the logic for blacklisting requests based on your needs and desired security parameters.

        Blacklist runs before the synapse data has been deserialized (i.e. before synapse.data is available).
        The synapse is instead contracted via the headers of the request. It is important to blacklist
        requests before they are deserialized to avoid wasting resources on requests that will be ignored.

            synapse (Simulation): A synapse object constructed from the headers of the incoming request.

                            and a string providing the reason for the decision.

        This function is a security measure to prevent resource wastage on undesired requests. It should be enhanced
        to include checks against the metagraph for entity registration, validator status, and sufficient stake
        before deserialization of synapse data to minimize processing overhead.

        Example blacklist logic:
        - Reject if the hotkey is not a registered entity within the metagraph.
        - Consider blacklisting entities that are not validators or have insufficient stake.

        In practice it would be wise to blacklist requests from entities that are not validators, or do not have
        enough stake. This can be checked via metagraph.S and metagraph.validator_permit. You can always attain
        the uid of the sender via a metagraph.hotkeys.index( synapse.dendrite.hotkey ) call.
